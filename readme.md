# PyTorch_101

The PyTorch Basic Operations notebook provides an introduction to using PyTorch, a deep learning framework. In this notebook, you will learn how to:

- Install PyTorch
- Use PyTorch to write deep learning programs

To use PyTorch, you can install it using the Python package manager `pip`:

```bash
pip install torch
```

Once PyTorch is installed, you can import it in your Python programs like so:

```python
import torch
```

To write deep learning programs with PyTorch, you will follow these steps:

1. Define a model
2. Prepare input data
3. Feed the input data to the model and make predictions
